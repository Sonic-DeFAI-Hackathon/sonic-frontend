- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.


we are using nextjs15 We use Next.js 15 and its subsequent updates (15.1 and 15.2) introduced significant enhancements over Next.js 14, focusing on performance, developer experience, and new features. Here's an overview of the key differences: Next.js 15 - React 19 Support: Introduced compatibility with React 19, allowing developers to leverage the latest React features. citeturn0search0 - Async Request APIs: Transitioned APIs like cookies, headers, params, and searchParams to asynchronous, enabling a more efficient rendering and caching model. citeturn0search0 - Caching Semantics: Modified caching defaults; fetch requests, GET Route Handlers, and client navigations are no longer cached by default, offering developers more explicit control over caching behavior. citeturn0search0 - Turbopack in Development: Marked Turbopack as stable for development, providing faster local server startup and improved code updates with Fast Refresh. citeturn0search0 Next.js 15.1 - React 19 Stable Release: Confirmed full support for React 19 in both Pages Router and App Router, ensuring stability and compatibility. citeturn0search1 - Improved Error Debugging: Enhanced error messages and stack traces in both the browser and terminal, simplifying the debugging process. citeturn0search1 - after() API: Stabilized the after() API, allowing execution of code after a response has finished streaming, useful for tasks like logging and analytics. citeturn0search1 - Experimental Authorization APIs: Introduced forbidden() and unauthorized() APIs for more granular authentication error handling, enabling customized responses for 403 and 401 errors. citeturn0search1 Next.js 15.2 - Redesigned Error UI: Introduced a new error overlay with improved stack traces, enhancing the developer experience during debugging. citeturn0search4 - Streaming Metadata: Allowed the initial UI to render before generateMetadata completes, improving performance by not delaying the initial paint for metadata fetching. citeturn0search4 - Turbopack Performance Improvements: Achieved up to 57.6% faster compile times and reduced memory usage during local development, making Turbopack more efficient than Webpack in most scenarios. citeturn0search4 - Experimental Features: Added support for React View Transitions and Node.js Middleware, providing developers with cutting-edge tools for creating dynamic and efficient applications. citeturn0search4 In summary, the progression from Next.js 14 to 15.2 brought substantial improvements in performance, error handling, and introduced new APIs, enhancing both the development process and application efficiency.
